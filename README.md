# OpenGL_Scene
The learning and application of this program was heavily based on 
[Computer Graphics Programming in OpenGL with Java by V. Scott Gordon and John L. Clevenger](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Graphics-Programming-OpenGL-Java/dp/1683920279/). 
 The bulk of the program is in Main.java.
